clone - to copy the git file in local machine
-git clone url of file

use ls -hidden to see hidden file in the folder like git file 

status - it will tell the current all file status like modified or untracked
modified mean we did some changes to a file locally which is also present in repo but not commited
untracked means we created a new file in local
-git status


staged - file ready to be commited

add - adds new or changed files in your working repo to git stagging area
-git add filename
-git add . (for all)


commit - it is the record of change
-git commit -m "some message"


push - upload loacl file(new created) to remote repo
-git push origin main 
//here origin is the name we given for the repo where we are pushing and main is the branch//



init
when we create a new file/repo loaclly then to make it a git repo use init command

//to make new file in terminal//
cd..
mkdir filename
cd filename
git init

//to add our new local repo in remote firt create a new repo in github //
then run this first
-git remote add origin link  //here origin is the name we are giving to new repo 

-git remote -v  //to verfiy the remote
-git branch //to verfiy branch
-git branch -m newname //to rename branch

//to push to our new repo in remote//
-git push origin main
    or
-git push -u origin main  //so that next time we dont have to write origin main everytime when we push




branch
to create multiple instants of a project to work on new feature by new group

-git branch                  //to check branch
-git branch -m newname       //to rename branch
-git checkout -b newbranch   //to create new branch
-git checkout branchname     //to navigate
-git branch -d branchname    //to delete


file of one branch is independent of other changes in one branch wont affect other

//to push our new branch to remote//
-git push origin branchname



merging

2 ways
1st - we can compare two branch before merge
-git diff branchname
-git merge branchname  //to merge the branch with current branch
then push that merge branch to remote 


2nd - pull request(pr) to give request to main branch for merge in github 



pull
-to to fetch and download content from remote rpo to local to match the content
-git pull origin branchname


merge conflicts
when we try to merge 2 branch with a file having same line but little different code from both branch file then this cause a conflict 
if they both have seperate line of code the no merging error  


undoing changes

case 1 - staged changes after git add
-git reset filename
-git reset  //for all
