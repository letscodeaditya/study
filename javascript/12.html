        //hoisting is when we use a var first and declare it late in the code but js interpreter after excuting look for the declartion and put them on top of code
        
        var x; //this is a declaration and its value right now is undefine by default, initialized by js

        let z; //in let js wont put undefined value for it, js dont initialize let

        a = 10; //here js will automatically declare it on top var a; 

        //to stop hoisting write this on top
        "use strict"

        //here it will show undefined bec js will only take the declaration part var y; not the assigment part =5; to top so it will show undefined  
        console.log(y);
        var y = 5;
